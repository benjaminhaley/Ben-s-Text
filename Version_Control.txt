Version_Control

I want all of my peronal files to have version control so I am more at liberty to modify them without fear of losing their content.

So I have setup an SVN server using the tortise client at C:/SVN or file:///C:/Users/Benjamin.Haley/Desktop/SVN 

Controls: (all right click)
	Add files : right click select add
	Commit changes : Right click and choose commit
	Revert to a previous version: I right click and choose Update... select previous version and click update

I need to automate the addition and committing of changes (perhaps when the scratch starts?)
