convert text files to html files
	So that I can make my files web-compatiable

This should be relatively easy.  I just need to set up a python script that will dig through my materials parse out any useful data and then add a header of my choice, a tail of my choice, change them into .html files and delete the txt files.

I also need to set this up as a template that I can work with in the future.
