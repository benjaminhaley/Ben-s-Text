	to memorize this great and enigmatic song to soothe myself and entertain my freinds.
	note when you can't sing it from memory

The Man who sold the world:
	We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
	Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
	Which came as some surprise, I spoke into his eyes
	I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

	oh no, not me
	I never lost control
	You're face to face
	With the man who sold the world
	
	I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
	I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed
	I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
	We must have died alone, a long long time ago

	Who knows, not me
	We've never lost control
	You're face to face
	With the man who sold the world
	
	(one pause)

	Who knows? Not me
	We've never lost control
	You're face to face
	with the man who sold the world
