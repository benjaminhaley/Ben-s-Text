    Its looking good, Haider has pulled together some interesting results and plots.  Today he needed me to help him generate a list of which animals had been Autopsied.  The results were pretty easy to generate.  I also retieved a list of primary causes of death for him.  In all I think it was a helpful and straightforward experience.  Its nice to work with Haider, its good to work with mathematically inclined doctors.

I got him a whole slew of statistics on the JM-3 experiment listed as "haider - JM3 tables.xls".  Like most people he wanted all of the stats in one table if it were possible, though we don't have the results in the wide format which I think will be irritating.
