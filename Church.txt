Church
	For those feeling dull, lonely, cold, anxious, or overwhelemed church gives inspiration, freindship, warmth, tranquillity and focus.
	This is my attempt to find a good church by attending a variety of masses.  
	My ideal church is warm, full of song, passionate preaching, with embracing greetings, fun, tollerant of others, close by, and followed by coffee.
	After collecting 10 churches I will aim for a more significant summary.

	The service was OK, the priest had a good sermon on looking for miracles within (rather than in the world) and people came together for saying the our father, holding hands in an intimate way.  I did however get really pissed at the nicean creed.  I don't want to be part of any church that believes in 'one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church' or in 'only son of god', this is not what God thinks of me!  So perhaps Catholic is out.  I didn't realize that church doctorine would be such a deal breaker for me, but as it turns out it is.  So it seems the catholics are out and so is any church that has that kind of bs in it's cannon.

	The greetings were wonderful, full church milling and acceptance.  The reverend was passionate but without aires.  The church was beautiful.  I was a little imberressed by a wrinkled shirt, eating the bread too soon and sitting obnoxiously interior of the pew making it hard to be passed items and hear the sermon.  The church was too empty, did not sing enough, demographically old and the pacing was a little slow.
