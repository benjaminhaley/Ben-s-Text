	To exeperience the joy of public speeking.

Went again and had a nice time saying hello again to Laura and Kenn while meeting and saying hi to Sheela.  I'm going to make a habit of this and it has inspired me to keep a new heuristic, (people communicated to)*(time communicated).  The only sorry thing is that I didn't get to get up for one of those exilerating two minute speeches.

Such an adreniline rush.  Kenn showed me in he was very warm and encouraging.  I met Laura who was sweet and reluctant.  I heard a number of good speeches from people struggling to overcome thier public speaking fears and foibles, then they forced me to speak.  My heart started pounding the room started spinning, it was a rush like skydiving.  I delivered poorly I'm sure, I would be careful to speak slower next time.  There will be a next time I need to find more, I'm totally hooked.
