To Do:
	Try graphing the intercorrelations below
	Try running an anlysis.


Intercorrelations:
	rads total v rads per day
	
	Age: Lifespan, First Exposure, Exposure Durations


Misc:
	10 point per event, but what of continuous events?
	How do we adjust for dogs that were killed early?
	we are worried that some pathological exams are more thorough than others, 
		would adding the number of pathological observations help?
		Any other ideas?
