stata_logistic_regression
	to learn logistic regression from stata to apply to the tissue data

should compare to stata_regression when done


Preanlysis:
	encode 0/1			dependent variable non-events are 0's, stata will assume all coded events are 1's (1)
	check n size			> 100 sample size
					> 10 observations per predictor (Long, 1997, pages 53-54) (1)
	clump low counts		categories that have very low counts when divided by the dependent outcome should be lumped somehow
	recode variables		for interactions, and non-linear variables
	check model assumptions		1. The true conditional probabilities are a logistic function of the independent variables. (not fatal)
    					2. No important variables are omitted.
    					3. No extraneous variables are included.
					4. The independent variables are measured without error.
    					5. The observations are independent.
    					6. The independent variables are not linear combinations of each other. (confirmed automatically)
	check for outliers		use the tools below to check for extreme outliers

	codebook [var]			- shows ranges, numbers missing, and values (good to check)
	summarize [var], detail		- shows the percentiles (good for continuous or lots of data)
	tabulate [var]			- good for small or discrete data
	historgram [var]		- density v value
	graph box [var]			- show density v value and standard error
	stem [var]			- a stem and leaf plot
	scatter [dep var] [ind var], mlabel[label]	- will help to identify extreme outliers
	recode [var] [val]=[val]	- just recodes a variable so that value equals a new value
	generate [new] = [var]*[var]	- makes an interaction variable to be included in the analysis
	


Analysis:
	logit [dep var] [indep vars]	- runs a simple logistic regression  (1)
						log likelyhood: odds of the occurance by chance (meaningless alone)
						Prob > chi2: significance of overall model
						_cons = log(odds) when variables == 0 
						coef.: a one unit change in this indep var will have a coef change in the log odds
						"or" option will display results as odds ratios
	logistic [dep var] [indep vars] - like logit, but displays the odds ratios (1)
						odds ratio: change in odds ratio of dep var with a one unit change in the indep var
	logit [vars] if e(sample)	- a logit that only includes samples that were used in the subsample (?) (1)
	xi : logit [var] i.[var]	- automatically inculdes the dummy variable breakdown in the regression 
						use char [var]"[omit]" [val] to affect which value xi will drop
	xi : logit [var] i[var]*i.[var]	- this will show the regression with an interaction between the multiplied variables
					test for interaction between variables by noting if the slope of best fit lines changes when one of the 
					interacting variables is fixed.

	

Post Analysis:
	est store [new name]		- stores the results of a regression under a new variable name (1)
	predict [new var]		- sets the [new var] as the outcome of the logistic regression (1)
	table [vars], contents(min [var] max [var])	- will show the min max table for a variable
	twoway scatter [vars]		- composes a scatter plot between two variables (1)
	fitstat				- runs a slew of 'goodness of fit' measures, for which there is not a general consensus (1)
	listcoef, help			- a few statistics on the goodness of fit of a logistic regression model (1)
	prtab [var]			- table of perdicted probabilities given certain assumptions (1)
	lrtest				- compares a stored regression to the last one to see if the additions to the model are significant (1)
						*this assumes that the regressions were run on exactly the same data (use " if e(sample)") (1)
	adjust, by [vars] exp		- will display the odds given each variable
	test [values]			- can test whether the values of variables in the model are significant (lrtest is probably better)
	table [vars], contents(mean var)- will produce a mean value table for the vars, useful for determining if thier is interaction between vars
	linktest			- if _hatsq is significant we have overlooked interactions in the variables (tests second assumption)
						*linktest will fail if _hatsq is highly correlated to _hat
	boxtid logit [vars]		- will determine the best power that a variable might be raised to, to explain its impact.
	collin [vars]			- used to detect colinearity between variables (assumption 6)
						if VIF is above 5 or 10 and tollerance is below .05 or .1 we should be worried
						after finding multicolliniearity, we might assuage its affects by centering
 
	predict [new], rstand		- produces a [new] variable containing the pearson prediction (eliminating bad data)
	predict [new], dev		- produces a [new] variable containing the deviance residual (eliminating bad data)
	predict [new], hat		- produces a [new] variable containing the Pregibon Leverage (eliminating bad data)

	Predict [new], dx2		- produces a [new] variable containing the difference of chi squared (finding goodness of fit affectors)
	predict [new], dd		- produces a [new] variable containing the difference of deviances (finding goodness of fit affectors)

	ldfbeta [vars - opt]		- produces variables of the form DFbeta([var]) which are the regressions run without any particular obs
							(tests observations effects on coefficients)
	predict [new],  dbeta		- produces a [new] var estimating the effect of an obs on the parameters (obs on coefficients)
						Plotting the preceeding seven against id or probablity will identify outliers for closer inspection						



*much ado about proper analysis, but the right analysis of a logit model is to randomly generate examples of the model and see how wide/tight the model fits them...
