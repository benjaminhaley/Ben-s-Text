Stata Cheat Sheet:

navigation:	cd, save, clear, memory, set memory, dir, pwd (working directory),
loading data:	insheet (spreadsheet), infile (txt), infix (fixed format), input (by hand), use(stata dataset)
data summaries:	describe, count, list, codebook, summarize, tabstat, table, tabulate (frequency tables), correlate, pwcorr
data graphs:	stem (stem and leaf), graph ( histogram or box plots)
data changes:	sort, label data, order (variables in a set), label variable, label values, rename (a variable), recode (variable values), 
		notes(addendum to the data file), generate (new variable), replace (values), egen (special functions for variable generation), 
		keep if, keep, drop, append, merge

log		Create a Log file

Analyses:	
	ttest		confidence interval for normal distributions with small n ( makes up for errors in estimating standard deviation )
	anova		particians variance into explanatory variables
	xi		produces a dummy variable which can be used in regression analysis to act as a 0,1 switch for parameters?
	regress		a regression which uses best fit to model a dependent variable as a function of independent variables and random error
			predict( instance of the model ), kdensity (kernal density - distribution of the random variable)
			pnorm (standard curve), qnorm (quantile real curve), rvfplot (residual v fitted plots?)
			test (tests linear hypothoses)
	logit		logistical regression fits a random binary outcome to a series of independent variables
	tabulate	cross tabs (comparison of values % for multiple inputs) with chi-squared tests (related to variance of a normal curve)
	signtest	used to show there is no difference between the underlying distributions of two variables
	signrank	tests for the relationships between subjects that are abnormal (non-parametric test)
	ranksum		non-parametric test to determine if two samples come from the same distribution
	kwallis		a non-parametric anova test (extension of ranksum) that does assume the variables have the same unknown distribution

*note: 
	"regress test" and "log" seem important and overlookable.
