Linear Regression
	To make a dependent variable a function of independent variables and an error term.


Assumptions
	Sample represents the population ( we can discuss this in relation to dogs, like do controls live 'normal' lives )
	Independent variable are error free (there are methods to use when this assumption is not met)
	Predictors must be linearlly independent (how do we test this)
	the error is random, has a constant variance, and are uncorrelated
	that variables are related geometrically (ie. pathogorean theorem applies)
	when confidence intervals are calculated it is based on an assumption of a normal distribution of the error term


	These assumptions garuntee that the treatment will be unbiased, consistent, and efficient though some may be relaxed


Proceedure
	
	A formula that relates the dependent variable, f(n), to the p independent variables, X1i - xpi, and a random error term, e.

		f(n) = B0 + B1x1i + ... + B2xpi + ei		i = 1,...,N

	The formula is usually minimized through minimization of the sum of squares of the error term.




Terms:
	categorical variables		aka nominal scales, a set of variables with unrelated discrete values
	ordinal variable		those with ordered discrete values
	censored regression		used when the dependent variable is only sometimes observed
	Heckman correction		A two step correction with a normality assumption that can be made when their is bias in sampling
	Non linear regression		
	logit				the log of the odds ratio used extensively in logistic regression
	probit				a function that converts the normal distribution to a straight line
	probit model			specification of the generalized linear model for a bernoulli trial that supposes the response to be a binomial distribution
	ordered probit			regression model for ordinal dependent variables
	multivariate probit		estimates correlated binary outcomes jointly
	multinominal logits		are used when the result variable of a logistic regression takes on three or more unrelated values
	ordered logit			regression model for ordinal dependent variables
	cumulative distribution func.	or just distribution function is the probability that the random variable is less than the obsered variable
	count data			that which can only take interger values that results from counts, not rank
	contingency table		just a matrix comparing the values of two or more varialbes
	poisson regression		a regression function for count/rate that assumes the response to be a possion distr.  log( E(Y) ) = a + bx
	non-linear regression		deals with any regression analysis where the contribution of the variables is assumed to be non linear	
	baysean linear regression	another method of minimizing the error in a regression by borrowing some terms from similar known measures
	Generalized linear model	provides a genearlization of all least squared regressions varying in distribution and link functions
	link function			transforms between the distribution and predicted value
