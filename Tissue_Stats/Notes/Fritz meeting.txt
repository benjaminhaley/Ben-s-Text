Know body dimensions
Cause of Death
Better understanding of the dataset at large

Notes:
	The average dose for the dog was .75 of the air dose, while even deeply internal organs probably recieved .50 or more (warren sinclair)
	All of the dogs were autopsied.   A standard number of tissues were removed
	Dogs with mid-life excisions/incisions in the pathology reports are likely to have mid-life tissue samples. (esp. mammory glands)
	The slides and blocks are dated. 
	Controls: lived unkenneled with a same-sex partner unless associated to an experiment.  Never bred.
	neutral buffered formalin was the standard for all dogs
	breeding was composed of two substrains 1. Alabama (very strong) (male dogno=78) and 2. blonde dogs
	drugs were only administered for veterinary concerns never for experimental reasons
	We think Cytology lines up with the blood slides
	SNOMED is a standard set of clinical terminologies used for large medical datasets
