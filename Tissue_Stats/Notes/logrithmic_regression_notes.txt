Logrithmic Regression

Analyzes bionomially distributed data and finds the maximum likelyhood regression coefficients of various factors that inform the probability assuming that the logarithm of these factors contributes linearly to the odds.


f(z) = 1 / ( 1 + e^-z )
  z  = b0 +b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn


binomially distributed data 	the outcome of independent binary events
OLS regression			ordinary least square regression, - useful for continuous variable prediction.
