Study Info
	grdina 91, 92 are good sources
    	pathologies were reported blind, and independently verified
    	Mouse DB categorizes lethal, non-lethal, and contributing to death
	Grdina says we need to use 200 animals
	Set at least 1 result/experimental group

Variable Types (linear, quadratic, categorical, etc.)
    	Dave almost always finds categorical assignment to be best
    	I might inform radiation curve with the dose response curve
        	wikipedia suggests this is sigmodial when plotted against the log(concentration) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dose-response_relationship
    	I might inform age curve with cancer v age curves online
		new cases seem to strike in an exponetial curve with age (though we are interested in the integral of this curve) http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/incidence/age/


Stats Methods
	Apply the Akaike or Basian tests to optimize the number of parameters in you model
	Use the lincom command to produce the odds ratios given a regression model
	test the possion distribution on counts
	ordinal regressions (see http://www.norusis.com/pdf/ASPC_v13.pdf)
	we maybe able to apply the lethal/non-lethal etc. distinctions to make dave's toxicity count into a toxicity sum
