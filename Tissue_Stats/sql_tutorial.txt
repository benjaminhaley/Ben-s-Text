Structured Query Language (SQL) Tutorial - from the W3C schools (http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
	So that I can better manipulate the dog and mouse tissue archives


Commands
	Distinct	Ensures that each result is unique
	Where		Is used to set criterion on one or more variables
	Like		an operator that searches for a regex pattern
	IN		match any value in a list ( WHERE...IN (a, b, c) )
	ORDER By	any number of column names followed by either ASC or DESC
	INSERT INTO	adds new rows and follows the form: table, columns, VALUES in_columns ( INSERT INTO table VALUES(...) )
	UPDATE		updates existing columns
	BETWEEN		looks for values between two values ( SELECT...FROM...WHERE column BETWEEN( max, min ) )
	TOP		specifies a number or % of records to return (like TOP 25 PERCENT)... might also be called LIMIT in mySQL
	LIKE		finds matches using wildcards ( % - 0 or more, _ 1 char, [a, b, c] any in list, [^a] any not in list
	AS		creates an alias for the selected columns so they can be handled easier ( SELECT...FROM...AS a )
	JOIN		returns results from two tables matched by keys.  
			A full join will return both tables if either match (SELECT...JOIN name ON name.column = from.column )
	UNION		Joins two select statements that have the same number/type/order of columns selected (SELECT...UNION...SElECT...)
	SELECT INTO	copies data from one table to another even between databases, good for backups (SELECT...INTO table IN database )
	CREATE		Either CREATE DATABASE or CREATE TABLE col1 type1 [CONSTRAINT1], col2 type2 [CONSTRAINT2]
	CONSTRAINTS	Limit the datatypes that can go into a created table column (above), 
			NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT
	INDEX		creates a quick lookup index on a table column ( CREATE INDEX name ON table (column,s) )
	DROP		used to delete tables, indexes, and databases
	TRUNCATE	deletes table data, but not its structure ( TRUNCATE table_name )
	ALTER TABLE	allows you to add or delete columns (ALTER TABLE table_name [ADD, DROP COLUMN, or ALTER COLUMN] column name)
	DATES		can be a pain to work with, look up the options if you need them
	IS NULL		the only way to test for nulls which are not equal to 0
	GROUP BY	orders by one variable's name (SELECT...FROM...GROUP BY column)
	HAVING		used to add conditions to aggregating functions in place of WHERE which fails 
			(SELECT...FROM...GROUP BY...Having condition)	
	

Access Data Types
	Text		255 char or less 
	Memo 		alot of text
	Byte		0-255 (1 bytes)
	Integer		-32000 - 32000 (2 bytes)
	Long		-2e9 to 2e9 (4 bytes)
	single		single precision floating point (4 bytes)
	double		double precision floating point (8 byte)
	Yes/No		(1 bit)
	Date Time	(8bytes)
	Ole		for large binary objects can be up to 1 GB
	Hyperlink	...
	Lookup Wizard	allows the user to select from a drop down of options (4 bytes)

SQL Functions
	AVG(), COUNT(), FIRST(), LAST(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), LEN(), ROUND(), NOW(), 
	UCASE(), LCASE()	convets a feild to uppercase or lowercase
	FORMAT()		changes how a feild is displayed like ( SELECT columns, FORMAT( Now(), YYYY-mm-DD )...FROM...)
	MID()			the middle of a string like ( SELECT MID( column, start, length )...FROM...WHERE... )



Facts
	1. Not Case sensetive
	2. Statements end with a semicolon
	3. RDBMS's consist of DML's and DDL's
	4. Updating indexed tables takes more time
	5. Queries can be nested so that one depends on another


Glossary

RDBMS			relational database management system is software that implements a database like oracle, DB2, Access, and mysql
Relational Model	describing a database as a collection of finite predicates variables that are constrained in value
Predicate		A way of describing a set such that the you describe the rules a memeber must follow to be included {x | P(x)}
DML			the Data manipulation language, like query, unpdate, and insert
DDL			the Data Definition language, like Create database, alter table, or drop index
Foriegn Key		A key that points to the primary key of another table
Finite model theory	the structure of first order logic across finite groups, graphs, and databases
First Order Logic	the formal deductive system known by many names that relies on predicate forms ( x | P(x) )
Dependency Theory	studies optimization when logical constraints (dependencies) are present
temporal database	one that supports intrisic temporally relavent values (like JFK was pres from 19XX to 19XX)
spatial database	one which is optimized to support objects that have a spatial dimension
