. *and heres the same peice of work where we drop out those dose variables

{com}. *again a small drop in the R2

. *next I need to determine if my other variables are masking data from the radiation varaibles by predicting them, and figure out a better way to account for the fact that gender is an absolute contributer.  Last I need to come up with a way to produce a graph where we see the effect of dose rate on risk for a population of older male dogs (those that are of interest anyways).
