Prostate Logistic Analysis
	to apply logistic regression to the dog prostate data in order to test for an effect of radiation on 'event' incidence


Analysis
	limits			only males, only those in CO-60-long or control, no duplicates
	dep var			occurance of hyperplasia or tumors (doens't matter if more than one obs was made for a single dog)
	ind var			lifespan, radsTotal, radsPerDay, death mode, first exposure age, radsTotal, radsPerDay, pathology count



Changes to dataset		"Controls and Co60-Long Total Package Condensed Morphology"
	null ages		Were made to be 0, because these dogs are listed as stillborn or <7days in their death codes
	null morphology		relabled 0 to enable 
	additions		added the first exposure age, death mode, pathology count
	death mode		grouped into 	natural  (<7, Age, Radiation, Sac Mor, Stillborn, Euth Disease)
					    and unnatural (Accident, Con. Sac., Exp Sac, Lost, Serial Sac, Trans, Euth Non Con)



Assumptions:
	n value is good 695 events with 132 occurances
	there are more than 10 occurances of categorical variables (Death Mode)
	interactions ???




Open ?s
	possible interactions??
	extraneous variables?
	independent variables?
