Prostate Logistic Analysis
	to apply logistic regression to the dog prostate data in order to test for an effect of radiation on 'event' incidence


Analysis
	limits			only males, only those in CO-60-long or control, no duplicates, none w/o pathologies reported
	dep var			occurance of hyperplasia or tumors (doens't matter if more than one obs was made for a single dog)
	ind var			lifespan, radsTotal, radsPerDay, death mode, first exposure age, radsTotal, radsPerDay, pathology count



Changes to dataset		"Controls and Co60-Long Total Package Condensed Morphology"
	null ages		Were made to be 0, because these dogs are listed as stillborn or <7days in their death codes
	null morphology		relabled 0 to enable 
	additions		added the first exposure age, death mode, pathology count
	death mode		grouped into 	natural  (<7, Age, Radiation, Sac Mor, Stillborn, Euth Disease)
					    and unnatural (Accident, Con. Sac., Exp Sac, Lost, Serial Sac, Trans, Euth Non Con)



Assumptions:
	n value is good 501 events with 132 occurances




Open ?s
	I should go over the stata manuals post analysis tools (http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?regress_postestimation)
	possible interactions??
	extraneous variables?
	independent variables?
	There is a clear line of dogs that is killed right at its first exposure, how can we analyze this kind of data?
		More generally there is a strong correlation between first exposure age and lifespan, but only for some doses
	Is a psuedo R squared of 0.25 worth anything?
	do the drugs cause cancer
	what are the effects of radioinjections
	are there inheretince effects of cancer
	proc?
	sire?
	birthno>?
	the exposure of dogs in utero?
	is there an effect of year on the pathologies


Analysis
	Log = prostate_analysis.smcl
	pathologycount, lifespan, and exposure time positively correlate, while dose rate negatively correlates
