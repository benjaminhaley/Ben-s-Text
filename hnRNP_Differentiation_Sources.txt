	HnRNP proteins are thought to play an important role in differentiation and development because they execute translational regulation mechanisms and exhibit cell type specific expression (doi:10.1006/excr.1995.1366).  Notably, Mouse Mutant Embroyonic Stem cell lines lacking hnRNP C form embryo bodies which require 3-4 weeks to develop morphologically distinct cell types like blood islands and beating cardiac tissue, as compared to wildtype controls which reach this stage of differentiation in 1-2 weeks (Molecular and Cellular Biology, June 2000, p. 4094-4105, Vol. 20, No. 11).  
	Some studies have elucidated relationships between specific hnRNPs and the formation of specific tissue types.  For example, immunohistochemistry performed on tissue samples from the cervical epithelium revealed an inverse correlation between hnRNP H and differentiation (doi:10.1128/JVI.79.14.9254-9269.2005).  Proteomic techniques and siRNA knockdown in N1E-115 cells have shown that hnRNP K represses p21 enabled neuronal differentiation by binding with the 3' CU rich portion of p21's mRNA precurser (doi:10.1074/jbc.M411119200).  Western blots and Immunoflorescence analysis performed on cells cultured from rat brain sections and incubated in adenosine dialdehyde showed that HnRNP A2 increases in oligodendrocytes prior to differentiating into MBP-positive cells, especially in the extranuclear component associated with granules that carry mRNA from the cell's body to its processes (10.1002/jnr.20014).  As discussed [earlier/later], elevated hnRNP A2/B1 protien levels often preceed morphological differentiation in lung cancer (sources... from paper?).  While, laser scanning confocal microscopy detects hnRNP A2/B1 co-localization with Actin and Prohibitin in MG-63 cells, which weakens during differentiation (PMID: 18606058).

TMI
  UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation has shown an interteraction between hnRNP H and HPV-16 L2 RNA in HeLa extracts.  Immunohistochemical detection of hnRNP H performed on tissue samples from the cervical epithelium revelead that its concentration was inversely correlated to the degree of differentiation suggesting a role in coordinating the life cycle of the HPV-16 virus which depends on differntiation and has RNA elements which are bound by hnRNP H (doi:10.1128/JVI.79.14.9254-9269.2005).
