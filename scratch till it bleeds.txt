scratch till it bleeds
	It is a bit irritating that the tickle brings up so many just closed files... I need a way to bias against that

Perhaps by adding a constant to the itchiness equation so that it becomes:

(deltaDateAccessed + C1) / (deltaDateModified + C2) = itchiness

if C2 = C1 = 60*60*hours
