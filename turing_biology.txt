Is Biology Turing Complete
	To evaluate biology's computational potential I must establish which biological systems map to a turing complete model of computation.

To Do
	model operations computationally
	post results/ invite members
	Find advisor
	Study molecular transformations		100 hours
	write paper				160 hours


To add to Turing Biology arguments:
RNA ligase is molecule which combines RNA's
5000 RNA editing sites have recently been discovered by a Erez Leinon (http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3515)

have dave, scoutens, tanja, eric, roder, ted, eric, etc read through this paper...
this article will be published in natural computing, then I will work on popular summaries that might be delivered to biological (plos1) and computational (acm) communities.  I will proceed to try and post these results on blogs like slashdot and biology news.net

this article from nature provides a nice overview of the current pan computational theories http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7245/full/459332a.html
