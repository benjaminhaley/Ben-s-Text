Biological_Computing
	How can we measure, model, and interact with the information processing capacity of biology.

Hypothosis:
	The information processing capacity of the cell is more abundant and energy efficient than silicon computing is or could be.  The future of human computation and medicine will come through capitalization of innate biological computation.

To Do:
	Work on Turing Paper		see http://locahost/Archives/turing_biology.txt
	Post results online		see http://localhost/Archives/Biological_Computation_Community.txt
	Caroline recommends getting a fulbright scholarship for study abroad purposes

A nice device to interact with cells would be a series of needles permanantly embeded in a long lived cell that could pump nucleotides in an out from another similar cell or a computing platform.  A large array of such devices might offer some very interesting possibilities.
