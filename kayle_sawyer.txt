	Kayle was here for the last few nights in town for the neuroscience conference.  He's a cool cat, layed back, quick to laugh, and super nerdy.  We had a fun time talking through death stats, lightning strikes, perception shifts, jackpot payouts, extreme neruoscience, farm schools, florescent tubes in the ground, and the ins/outs of the health care bill.  Real cool cat, likes high quality beer, I'm sure that I could hang with him with ease some day.  His work is focused on MRI imaging, particularly of responses to various pictures seems pretty cool.
