Python Programming challenge:

1. Is just 2 ** 38 = 274877906944
2. Ceaser Sipher shifting two late = 'ocr'
3. find rare letters  = 'equality' 				(script below)
4. strip '/n's find l's in sBBBlBBBs = 'linkedlist'	 	(script below)
5. recover and parse a url = 'peak.html'			(script below)
6. unpickle banner.p and print sets as lines = 'channel'	(script below)
7. unzip, follow path, get comments, read letters, 'oxygen'
