    took a bit too long to parse out all of my personal data (5 hours) but I feel that the order that is has been put in is good, it will work for future sorting, and it will have applicability to my other time sheets.  So in the end, its all gravy baby.  It also shows me how big of a problem building this kind of review software can be.

    I finished off the task of parsing the time sheet data and dividing it into categories.  I still need to do a little more work on splitting those categories into actual project pages (like janus_wsdl.txt) and things that should more accurately be called categories like computer_administration.  This brings up some interesting issues of whether I should use a graph or not.  But for the fruits of my labor, I now have a preliminary breakdown of where my time went.  The highlights are written in the post above.
