It seems to be solving the paper commenting and sharing side of science that is so very important.  I would be really glad if this is true, because this part of the problem is not the most interesting to me.  I am really interested in promoting a standard in scientific publication that makes the process of peer review the responsibility of the people cited by the paper.  I think this is a natural and critical upgrade in scientific publishing.
