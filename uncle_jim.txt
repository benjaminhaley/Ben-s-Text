	Times with good old uncle Jim

11:23 AM 4/18/2010
	Went to visit him after the cubs game along with Anna and Mike.  We spent some time sipping beers and sluggers and then going to Ian's for crazy pizza by the slice (the mac and cheese pizza is delicious).  Saw Jim's freind Pat.  Jim bought pizza and beers so nice of him.  Mark went to Panama City Florida for break.
