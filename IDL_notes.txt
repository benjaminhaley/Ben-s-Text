IDL is an array programming language that is very fast with arrays, and not much else.  It is dynamically typed

Pitfalls:
	Only one namespace (can be gotten around using objects)
	no empty, variable sized, or nested arrays
	function arguments are passed by reference
	object oriented features require memory allocation form the programmer
	Array slices are passed by value, while arrays are passed by reference
	does not promote automaticlly on overflow, so loops will fail on their 32,768 iterationunless the iterating variable is made to be long
	The default data formats have liscences which prohibit other programs from interfacing with them w/o a liscence
