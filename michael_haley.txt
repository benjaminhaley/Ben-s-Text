	My brother Mike

	We celebrated Mikey's bday at the China Chef as a family along with Anna, Roder, and Rick.  As it turned out 4 entries and a slew of appetizers was just enough food for the all of us to eat.  So good!  Rick is looking good from all his working out in preperation for Jamacia.  Roder is enjoying his new more relaxed work environment which doesn't require full time labor out of him, because they are feeling the economic squeeze.  Mom is dating two dudes now.  Ally is performing constantly.  Oh yeah and Lauren was there too.  She is going to school in Michigan.
