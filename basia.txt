	I just wished Basia a happy birthday because my calendar sent me a reminder even though I'm not sure it is actually her b-day because it conflicts with the date on facebook.  See the email at http://mail.google.com/mail/?hl=en&shva=1#all/1261e255e1933472
	There is a lot of time that I have not covered with Basia, I have known her since I came into lab around 2006.  To give a breif summary, basia was a post-doc student from poland that worked in our lab.  She left lab and went to U of I to do a post bach program.
