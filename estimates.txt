estimates.txt
	An attempt to quantify how much time various proceedures take in my life to determine how best to plan my behavior

To Do:
	







11:22 - 11:47 - vocab review
	700 in news_glossary

15 minutes for 50 items, must break up sessions
34/50 correct = 70%
1000 words/year about 3/day
Within the next 6 months I will be near 1000 words,
considering time for review of missed words a/(1-r) or 1000/(1-.7) = 1500

so 7.5 hours over 30 days to initiate
0.25 hours every two weeks from here to eternity (or the forseeable future)




Basic Estimates:
	Text Books take about 
	Review takes about 25% of original read time
	10 hours of work/day.  5 hours at a time on a textbook
	7000 words/hour, 400 words/page, 20 pages/hour for first read.
	100 rss/hour
	A full class tends to take 50-150 hours over 10 to 30 days

CS subject exam (Oct 10th)
	82 hours over 9 days
		exam results: 46/70 top 91%
		missed: oo 2, networking 2, OS 2, stupidity 5, 
		algorithm 3, misc 1, languages 4, parellel 2, encryption 1
	Plan:
		algorithms: Review Algorithms (17.5 hours over 4 days), 
		languages: Discrete Math (12 hours over 3 days)
		stupid: Retake Practice exam (3 hours over 1 day)
		oo: Design Patterns (30 hours over 8 days)
		Networking: tutorial(http://tinyurl.com/nywqm6) (7 hours over 2 days)
		os: tutorial (http://tinyurl.com/3od2vg) (2 hours over 1 day)
		concurrency: tutorial (http://tinyurl.com/29cs3z) (2 hours over 1 day)
		cryptography: tutorial (http://www.netautopsy.org/whatcryp.htm) (2 hours over 1 day)
		cliques wiki (1 hour over 1 day)
		newton's method (1 hour over 1 day) 
		c++ tutorial (http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) (5 hours over 1 day)

News Estimates
	All news 220/day (about 2 hours/day)

Toastmasters 
	Commute + meeting + preperations = 4 hours every two weeks

Linera Algebra
	total 60 hours over 12 days
	text 35 hours over 7 days
	lecture 25 hours over 5 days


delicious review 
	11:47 - 12:40 AM 9/11/2009 - 
	can search for minus tags using the main search and double clicking
	20 minutes to do 10 tags about 2 minutes/tag
	145 tags base
	145 tags/ month, 5 tags/day

	5 hours over 5 days base
	1 hour every week

exercise
	2:05 PM 9/11/2009 - 
	Exercise will take 1 hour per session with a maximum of 4 sessions per week


google reader
	2:07 PM 9/11/2009 - 
	I want to look over material I have starred and shared
	I want to determine which resources should be kept based on stars
	reader offers cool stats in the reading trends section
	looks like wired, nature, science newbie and know your memes are wasting time
	1 star in 30 is about par
	the delicoius accounts are doing well.

	More detials at the reader_stats.ods

	I don't want to go over the reader in more detail, because I am keeping my stats on the more open delicious

chicago researchers
	9:29 PM 9/12/2009 - 10:30 + 8:10 PM 9/15/2009 - 
	Step 1 find subjects of interest http://experts.uchicago.edu/subject-index.php (162/794 in ten minutes 1 hour per school)
		24 subjects selected (will be 125 total per school)
		There are only 400 experts per school
	Step 2 parsing 9/43 seemed interesting so perhaps 100 will be worth exploring per school (1 hour)
	Step 3 10 people down to 2 to email so 20 will be writeable per school (1 hour/10)
	step 4 writing (30 minutes/peice)
	step 5 calling (30 minutes/peice)

*parsing this data will be made easier by the fact that the researchers are labled by id, I can treat it as a collecting id's problem in the early phase and use this to wipe out redundancy

	Multiplying this process out we have:
	3 schools * step 1 		= 3 hours
	1200 researchers * step 2 	= 30 hours
	300 interesting res * step 3	= 30 hours
	60 writiable res * step 4	= 30 hours
	60 callable res * step 5 	= 30 hours
	
	Total 123 hours (whew!... fortunately I don't have to be exhaustive)


World researchers
	I will check stanford, harvard, berkeley and MIT, should be similar to the chicago problem

	160 hours (too much!)	
	



Comedy Investigations:
	10 hours 	set up comedy plan (look up metromix, contact Miller's freind, does Michael know a joint)



Blogging time 
	2 hours/week, just alot it and we'll see what happens, this is not a priority


review of: ideas, questions, txt files: fix names, links, junk, consolidating, linking tags
	2 hours/week, again not a priority (yet)









Chicago researchers
	120 hours over 60 days (for 60 researchers)

National Researchers (harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford)
	160 hours over 80 days

Comedy Investigations:
	10 hours over 10 days

Blogging time 
	2 hours/week


review of: ideas, questions, txt files: fix names, links, junk, consolidating, linking tags
