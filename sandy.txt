	My relationship with Sandy from KIPP

2/2/2010
	Sandy called me out of the blue this weekend.  I found out that she was working in Naperville and that it was going so/so.  She was really in a mood to travel, but only gets a few weeks off a week.  I was kinda lost for words with her, but it was nice to catch up anyways.
