	I've just finished up the halozyme work and I think that now would be a good time to do some review and planning for the next few months.

12/17/09
    I just filled out the era commons for Gayle, turns out it wasn't needed for some reason.  I did however write down the password and give to to Kristen for future reference.
    I have finished up the wine stats, the final part was very easy, it probably only took 15 minutes
    I have started drafting the MTA, I really wish I had worked on this earlier, because it really is quite easy considering that the office will do it for me.  Yet again the lesson is to call first and then do leg work.
    Just finished returning the macrocodes on the janus website.  You can see the steps in this at return_macro_codes.txt
    Performed the monthly backup of the external hardrive.  I must admit that it is a bit of a pain, but then again so is life.  I really wish we had a second set of cords for the drives.
    Finished making the janus macro codes searchable.  It was a nice lesson in refactoring, pulling form inputs from the database, sanity proofing work, and scripting the process in advance.  The full notes are available at janus_macro_codes.txt

12/10/09
    I just spent the last hour and a half building an endnote citation library for Tanja.  This is a necessary task at this point, but it was made necessary by a lack of planning.  The citation were not well managed through the life of the document.  So the work I did repeated work done previously to organize a system of references.  It would have been better if that previous work had been maintained with its documents, if they had moved as pairs.  Storing them in the same folder together would be a good start in this effort, putting them in dropbox would be even better.  
    I just cleared up the missing research totals on the janus tissue search, but I learned that lo-and-behold, the has_micro stipulation was responcible for the entire thing.  I don't understand why that stipulation is in place on the search to begin with.  I have taken it off in the hope that it will 
    I also just started adding in the macro-codes to the search results which involved translating the topology and morphology codes into their more descriptive forms from the snomed codes.  Hopefully I can get these classified in the same way as the micro pathologies and thereby have them searchable, but we shall see...

    Finished up the first pass of the wsdl document.  Now I need to proof that it is OK, and I will use eclipse to do that.  It is worth noting that eclipse has tools for developing wsdl communication tools which I might have used from the onset, still I think the way that I have developed things has given me a richer sense of the underlying protocol.  Perhaps I would have been best off to generate a very simple wsdl document entirely by hand and then gone off into a wsdl generating program, but either way no bother, its been very fun to work on.  The only thing is that I should be getting back to the paper and I'm still a ways away from that.  The process of tying this web service back into a known vocabulary is still a black box for me.  I suppose I will be with it soon.  Too bad its been so fun.  Next project I am on I must be sure to have a customer straight off the get go so that I can try to suit their interests.

    Worked on fixing the distillation pump and found it was so much faster to have many eyes (Caroline, Ye, and I) on the problem.  Ye noticed that the trigger was stuck making a false leak, I figured out how to remove the casing and which replacement part it was, caroline found the manual, cleared space, and identified the problem itself.  Perhaps the lesson here is that when exploring a new system, many eyes are a useful replacement for expertise.

Summary of Experience

	In the first month, I submitted the hnRNP paper after adding a paragraph on differentiation, addressing Tanja and Gayle's corrections, and proofing acronym use, comma usage, and sources.  Dave introduced me to computer administation (backups + permissions), the databases (locations and naming conventions), the FTP client, webserver, and stata.  Then, Tanja, Dave, and I drafted a plan for the dog tissue database which I will work on next.  Most importantly, I ran and wrote a report on the winestats.

Overview: 
    I started work at my current post during Aug of 2008.  I took over for Dave who trained me.  Since starting I have successfully submitted the hnRNP paper.  I put the dog tissue database online (janus.northwestern.edu/dog_tissues).  To do so I had to learn SQL, html, php, and javascript and become intamitely familiar with the archives themselves through their myriad documentation and talks with Dave, Tom Fritz, Angela, and the lab.  I've run many wine stats and other issues of routine maintenence at the lab, backups printer installations, program installations, computer troubleshooting.  These activities culminated in the woloLIMS project which added dropbox, desktop search, automated backup, and internet access to all of the lab's machines.  I failed to successfully oversee Nathalie for her summer work and have only performed preliminary statistical analysis on the tissues.  I've worked with Michael Gruenberger from the ERA to coordinate the data from our studies and have done the appropriate background research on data sharing, SOAP, WSDL, RDF, and so on.
    These activities have taken a total of 934 hours or about 23 weeks of full time labor.  A more detailed breakdown of my time use is available from bens_job_time_sheet_archives.txt
