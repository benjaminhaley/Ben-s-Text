Settlers Game User Interface
    this document is aimed towards the development of only the game
    page's UI, other aspects of the interface like the login, registration
    and top bar are not included
    
    
Gererally
    The UI will be responsible for intelligently laying out game objects
    on the page in a way that's customized for the player looking at it
    and the game state.  It is not required to understand game logic or
    operations.
        Updates should be pushed from the game abstraction layer and we
    should also maintain the ability to pull updates when we like (for
    cases like reload).  So UI objects should generally have a last
    updated function.
    
What will a UI need to know
    Here's is an unordered list of things that the user interface will
    need to be able to grab from the game abstraction in order to stay
    current
    
    What's on the dice, are they being rolled?
    What player am I presenting to?
    Who's turn is it?
    What actions can be taken immediately?
    What's the chat history?
    What's the order of the tiles and the numbers on them?
    What cards do people have?
    How many points to people have?
    Who has largest army, longest road?
    Where are the cities, villiages, roads, and barbarians?
    What colors are the players?
    What is the actual graphic associated with all of my elements?
    How many points do people currently have?
    Is there a card being played?
    Is there a trade being proposed?
    Has a trade been accepted?
    Has a card been selected for play?
    and so on
