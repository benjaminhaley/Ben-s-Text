Nice An' Holier

I've made it a mission to find a church to go to for community, love, song and prayer.  And I've gone to a mass and sermon so far, which, on the whole, were wonderful.  Still, in each I have been fit to be tied after hearing this damn nicean creed.  My problem is the exclusive tone in the creed.  Phrases like 'true god', 'one church' and 'one baptism' drive me bananas.  Each and everyone of us in the church is supposed to swear by that oath.  It makes me feel like a kindergartner mindlessly reciting the pledge of alligence.

When I think about it really hard, which I do, I don't believe in the exclusive propaganda that the nicean creed espouses.  From where I sit, it's antithetical to the embracing spirit of love and humility Jesus preached.  He spent most of his time with 'outcasts', reminded us that we were all brothers and needn't judge lest we be ourselves.   The nicean creed sounds more like the dogmatic, closed and self-richeous beliefs espoused by the pharisees.  I don't believe that I am part of some holy chosen people or that I would be fit to judge it if I were.  I just want to find a weekly gathering that promotes love, improvement, humility, and kindness sans richeous self-aggrandization.

Trouble is that study shows that this nicean creed is a foundational oath in the Christian churches of the world.  So unless someone can enlighten me I am stuck exploring some other religions to find a way to weekly excersize my faith.
