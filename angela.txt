    I just spent time working through the list of most common cancers and then annotating that list with results from the research.

	I just came into work only to have Angela bail on me in the last moment.  I think that is partly the plight of the doctor, but it would have been really nice to know in advance so I wouldn't have had to have come all the way to work.  In the future I can probably get around that just by sending her a text before I leave asking if we are still on.
