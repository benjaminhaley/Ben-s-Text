HTML

To learn HTML so I can scratch results from the Google Desktop Search API (see http://localhost/Archives/Google_Desktop_Search_API.txt)
and work on the dog tissue database (see http://localhost/Archives/Northwestern_Job.txt)

HTML tags can be used for page layout, link structure, javascripting and various other objects.  I will be going through the tutorial at the w3schools and developing a series of quizes to test my knowledge.

... afterwards study Web Serving, CSS and XHTML


currently I am jumping way forward.  I have a basic understanding of how tags work and the like I can look up more later, but chances are that I will be using frameworkds in the future and will not have to deal with the displaying code directly.  Instead I will be jumping around to issues like how to use style sheets, interact with a server and so on.

CSS
HTML 4.01 validation and specs
XHTML
