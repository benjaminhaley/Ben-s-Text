	My mother

4/9/2010
	Grabbed lunch with Anna, Dereck, Matt, and Mom at Gino's east.  Mom's so talkative :).  Her sis is worried about her love woes, but I think she's doing fine.

	Just got back from easter fondue quite the treat.  I had a chance to hunt for eggs with elizabeth, talk board games and roast coffee with dave, and hear about mixed martial arts from Kathrine.  FYI dave drinks apple cider, Kathrine drinks light non-hoppy beers, and elizabeth drinks Green River.
	I saw the Scoutens and told Matt about the meetup at bally doyls and heard about how Chuck Saved Fargo.
	Mom, Michael, and Anna, are all a tid bit meloncholy.  Ally is truly blonde.  Mom misses her Tom and wonders how she was so stupid as to believe him when he said he was still exclusive.  Micheal goes through a long dirty fight with Gabs.  Anna misses her family which is a feeling exacerbated by visiting mine.
