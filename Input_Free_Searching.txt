Input_Free_Searching

I just realized that google is working really hard at input free searching, but all of the results they deliver are advertisements.  This is a problem.  Often the side links on an email or other peice of data a user is employing without explicit searching should not be ads.  Most appropriately the advertising value of the link should be weighted against value to the user.  If the most valuable data out there for the user is an advertisement that is what should be delivered, but if the most useful peice of data is one of thier own files or something of the sort, they should deliver that content instead.
