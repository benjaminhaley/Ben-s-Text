Prototype_Based_Programming
	Prototype-based programming (like Java Script) avoids classes for behavior reuse or inheritance.
	It relies instead on the cloning of existing objects which serve as prototypes for the object that seeks to reuse the behavior.
	This allows programmers to think of the behavior of their example needs and later focus on classifying these objects into archetypal objects.
