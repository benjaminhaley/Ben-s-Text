Dave is in the habit of changing his mind on issues without acknowledging that he has.  For instance he said he would talk to Cecille one day and later said that he would have trouble and didn't have her number.  He said one night that he was happy to get blue??? server and the next day that he thought thier service was slow.  I am sure thier are a couple more examples of this during the trip planning.

I find this trait irritating because he is negating my positions (comming to the city to party with cecille and buying the blue??? service) when my positions are based on his previous statements.  I would like him to aknowledge that he realizes he was mistaken before and that this misguided my logic now.

I must forgive him these points and work hard to articulate this feeling if I notice an instance of it in the future.
