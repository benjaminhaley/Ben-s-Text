	Spent a small portion of the evening with Eric.  He was pretty tired and so we didn't have that much time to hang.  I did, however, learn about the crazy greatness of cevechae which is cooked by lime juice.  I don't think graduate school has picked up for him.  He came with his brother William, now old enough to go to bars.  William is doing well, soon to graduate from Iowa state.  Too bad it was such a short visit, I think Eric was once again offended that Drew ditched on the plans, though I totally understand where Drew was comming from.
