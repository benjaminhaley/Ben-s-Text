	A geography quiz hosted by James the first monday of every month at the whirlaway lounge

Location:
	Whirlaway lounge: 3224 W Fullerton (the blueline's logan square stop)

	I met up with Anna and her freinds Adrian, Margrette, Michael, and Kara.  Brita was there too and James's freind Ralph.  We did fine enough at the quiz, no winners, but pretty close on the natural disasters one.  I punched Anna after one of the questions, she head butted me.  I learned that bangladesh suffered hardly any casualties following the tsunami because of the direction of the fault line.  I learned that Margret is working on the issue of developing a reading list.  I learned that James is thinking of opening a coffee shop in the logan square region.
