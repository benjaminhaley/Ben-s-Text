	My interactions with meggan greet

01/11/2010
	Meggan just got back from abroad and I had an evening (saturday) to hang with her, elise, justin, zach, and one of zach's dudes.  It was pretty awesome, Meggan is so glad to be back in chicago.  We played asshole.  Elise was desperate for a conversation about critical theory and fashion.  I played the Kill Hannah 'welcome to chicago' song for Meggan.  She loved it.
