	Between today and yesterday I rolled through these letter issues.  The big stumbling block that I was able to overcome was finding specific department to apply for.  Actually it was so much easier to see where I wanted to be when I moved through schools by department and program.  I guess my original plan to go by researcher was intrinsically flawed.  I think the lesson here is that I should have taken it upon myself to experiment with both approaches and see what was more doable, pretty much always a good idea on any project that will take time and you haven't done before.
	I also took the time out to write up complementary notes to the people that I am asking for recommendations from.  I think that was a great exercise.  Not only did I realize all the things that these people have done for me, I gave them a chance to feel good about themselves midday and fueled their desire to write nice rec letters.  That's kind of a win win win.  Today I sent the letters and got immediate and nice responses from Gayle and Shelley.

	finding Dr. Whitt's contact info* was especially hard because I didn't remember his name accurately, Michael's suggestion of going via his department was golden.  Now I'm stuck on how exactly I need to request the letter of reccomendations.  I'm not sure whether I need them to send copies directly to the school or to me, also do they need to be sealed.
