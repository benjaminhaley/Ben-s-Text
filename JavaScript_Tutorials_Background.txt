JavaScript_Tutorials_Background
	Writing, running, and editing JavaScript and tutorial written conventions

JavaScripts are embedded in HTML documents and can be written in any ordinary text editor and opened with any ordinary web browser (see:http://localhost/Archives/My_First_JavaScript.txt or http://localhost/Archives/My_Second_JavaScript.txt).  For easier testing of JavaScript code open Firefox>Tools>Error Console.  Script written in the code box can be evaluated without the need to save a document and reload a page.  For more power, download and execute the Firebug JavaScript extension which contains a DOM inspector (see http://localhost/Archives/DOM_Inspector.txt), JavaScript debugger, profiling tool (see http://localhost/Archives/Profiling_Tool.txt), console and more.  The console in Firebug is useful for providing a kind of 'print' function for javascript, which has no native function to print to a standard output.  This function is known as console.log() which can be used in place of alert() to print running information.

When reading this manual it is important to keep in mind that in thier url examples they use http://server.domain/path/file.html. For me the server is localhost the domain value is void, the path is Archives and the file.html is the file name.
