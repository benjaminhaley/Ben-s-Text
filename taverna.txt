taverna.txt
	exploring the taverna workbench to figure out what our output needs to be.



How do I add our services
	1. right click on available processors
	2. add new wsdl scavenger
	3. *but in my case I get an error "Type {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}Array is refereced but not defined" In other words my wsdl is crap.


wsdl examples

taverna workflow examples
	we could make one of these for the radiobiology archives and model it after the workflows you find in the examples.


Annotate our sercvices so that they can be discoved by the Feta discovery tool (I think from the feta registry)


To note Taverna crashed during my trial of the Feta discovery service.  Perhaps I was click happy. - oh fooey!
