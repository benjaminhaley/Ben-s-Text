	I gave Alex a quick tour of what kind of info is available on the Janus website and how to search for it.  I advised him to tootle around and become familiar with the information.  In the meanwhile, I advised him to ask Tanja about a hypothesis and seek consultation from Will on what statistics might be applicable.
