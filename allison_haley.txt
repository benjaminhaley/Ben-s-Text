    Allys bday day.  Really fun in the end.  Ally was a bit of a crabapple because she is 17, but she had a ton of fun when we bowled and played Blokus (Mary liked it too).  We gave Ally a lot of shit for being young, but she also had a great deal of fun being in charge for 15 minutes.  Mary is all a twitter about heading off to L.A., and of course everyone loves Anna.  Michael was a sleepy dog but we managed to get him up.

	Ally had a choir concert (https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox/127218ad4ac2a582), it was really fun.  They sang a rendition of Ava Maria that was wonderful.  We went out for pie afterwards and cracked up with Ally, though she is more 16 than ever...
