	My good old family freind Matt


3/17/2010 - Hang at Matt's place
	I spent some time playing backgammon and mancala over at Matt's new apartment.  It was a fun time, he provided dinner and beer, so nice of him.  I was happy to learn that he's been losing a pound a week by working on his treadmill and watching TV.  
	Mancala's a good game to play because we are of fairly balanced skills as opposed to backgammon which is intutive for me, but a thought provoking exercise for Matt.  He talked a new practice at his job, ThinScoping, which has all of the teams working on the same user interface question at the same time, so that all of the gateways can stay in sync.
