I saw Sam this weekend when we did a memorial day bbq at the Haley house.  He is currently doing a child psychiatry rotation (which he chose because it is easy) and will soon be on his way to a radiology rotation.  He hopes to go into radiology because so far he has not enjoyed the options that he has worked on.
