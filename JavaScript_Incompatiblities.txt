JavaScript_Incompatiblities:

	Most incompatiabilities are due to browser failure to support elements of the Document Object Model (see http://localhost/Archives/Document_Object_Model.txt).  There are also subtle differences between JavaScript versions, there are elements of JavaScript in Mozilla, JScript in Internet Explorer and ECMAScript in Opera and Safari which are version specific and do not work in other implementations.  To overcome problems with incompatibilities, programmers may employ browser sniffing which seeks to detect the users browser based on client properties.  This technique is made more difficult by Microsoft's spoofing (fooling 'em) actions and a proliferation of web browsers.  So web authors have begun to employ object detection to overcome incompatibilities, by testing for the presence of a browser provided object before employing it in code.  This means that code that cannot run does not run instead of raising an error.  Last programmers rely on standardizations like ECMAScript and the Cascading Style Sheets to avoid bringing users to error messages.
