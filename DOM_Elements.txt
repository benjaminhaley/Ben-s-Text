HTML and XML are made of elements (nodes) denoted by <start> and stop </start> codons.  These elements are objects which support methods, properties and events.  Important W3C specifications apply to these elements (DOM Core, COM HTML, and DOM Events).  The following describes the shared interfaces between elements in the Gecko engine (which is under firefox's hood).  It must be noted that other engines might not support these elements while some elements in Gecko may support many more interfaces (for example the HTML Table Element and HTML Form Element).
