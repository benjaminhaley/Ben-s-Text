Proffessor Goldberg,

This is Ben Haley from the Woloschak lab.  I stumbled on your groups page in my hunt for a PhD program.  The remote robotics projects you are developing are really amazing, especially the efforts implementing collaborative telerobotics over the web.

Personally, I'm looking for a PhD program building remote access to live cell interfaces.  There are a few groups at Berkeley building bioMEM and microfluid cell control systems.  I'd really like to be involved in building a telerobotic web interface like yours to connect these new cell interface technolgies to remote researchers.

I can see that you are doing some bio work, but nothing focused on individual cells.  If that's a project that appeals to you, I would love to have a chance to talk to you further.

let me know, thanks much,

Ben
