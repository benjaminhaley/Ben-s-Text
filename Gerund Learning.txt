Gerund Learning
	Courtesy of my freind, Elise, I've been reviewing the ever so scinitillating Elements of Style by Strunk and White.  White, as if you didn't know, is of Charolette's Web fame and strunk was his rather strict college professor from some ancient time long past.  The synergistic efforts of these two minds is a cute little book that quickly reviews the basics of English sentence composition from grammar to, you guessed it, style.  The topic I recently came across is the neffarious Gerund.
	You see the gerund, in so far as I understand it, is a noisy little peice of the English language that takes a verb, an ing, and a few optional accompaning words and makes them into a noun.  You're liable to have run across one in your daily life.  For example if you have ever said.
	
	I love eating. 		-or	 	Eating food makes me happy.

You are using gerunds to profess your love of food.  The trick is that 'eating' or 'eating food' work as nouns in the sentences.  To verify that you know what a gerund is just replace a suspect phrase with a regular noun and prove to yourself the sentence still works.  For example, we might use the noun 'a gerund' in place of the gerunds above.

	I love a gerund.	-or-		A gerund makes me happy.

See how these sentences still make sense, this is because we are replacing nouns with nouns.  Note also how it is difficult to know what these would ever be used for?  Well in that sense they are very much like a gerund.  And my hat goes off to Strunk, White, Elise and Wikipedia for bringing thier meaning to me.
