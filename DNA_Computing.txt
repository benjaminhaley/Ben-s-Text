DNA Computing
	The prospect of using nucliec acids as a computation device.

Summary:
	DNA is common, non-toxic, and cheap.  DNA computers are many times smaller than today's computers; two grams of DNA holds one trillion gigabytes of memory.  The computing power of a teardrop-sized computer, using DNA logic gates, would be more powerful than the world's most powerful supercomputer (what does this mean?). The large scale parrellel processing possible using DNA computers would enable powerful decryption tools...
