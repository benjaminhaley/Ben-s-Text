Tom Knight, a researcher at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and one of the leaders in the biocomputing movement.
Tim Gardner, a graduate student at Boston University, recently made a genetic system that can store a single bit of information— either a 1 or a 0.
Collins, Elowitz and others want to do instead is forward-engineer biological circuits, or build novel ones from scratch.
