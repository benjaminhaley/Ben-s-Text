	I went out to brunch at Orange with Mary, the fam and anna.txt it was a lovely time.  We bought her Orange flowers and the resteraunt of the same name was totally wonerful.  They had an automatic orange juicer that was one of the coolest devices I have ever seen (picture in journal).  After brunch we went back to the burbs and were able to play cities and knights with the whole family before laying around on the floor chitty-chatting and making the most of life.  Quite lovely.
