	Picking out an appropriate machine to process APS data

related docs: stefan.txt

Summary:
	I spent about 16 hours on this process all told.  My notes are listed below.  The most helpful thing that I did was contact stefan and ITT with my specific questions.  I would have done better if I had gotten a full set of reccomendations from Ye, tested the machine, or saved time.  In the end our first idea didn't work so we went with a cheaper one.  I should have gotten a price from T at the get go and short of that I should have priced out three options, super cheap, super pricey, and a middle of the road.

From Stefan:
	64 bit, >6 G of ram, 4 or more processors, 30" monitor will require dual link DVI, the processes are floating point

From Ye
	Dell XPS 730S: Vista, quad core 17 975 extreme, 3.3 GHz, 64 bit, SSD, RAID, 3 yr warentee, 6 G DDR3 RAM ($5000)


From Ben
	SPEC2006 is a CPU-intensive benchmark suite, CFP2006 is its floating point component
	From the CFP2006 (CFP2006.xls) the intel Xenon X processors perform the best at floating point
	Dell Precision T3500 (Intel Xeon W3570, 3.20 GHz) has great numbers 95 at a base cost of $2159 (a cheaper model is 1/2 power)
	
From ITT
	The company that liscences IDL has the following page giving minimum requirements and the supported packages for various hardware platforms http://www.ittvis.com/ProductServices/IDL/PlatformSupport.aspx
	Josh (there tech support guy) says that we need x86, x86_64/AMD, or Sparc (not Itanium)

From Tanja
	Should be lower than $2500

ECC - Error correction codes correct errors from memory which can lead to system crashes, useful for servers, perhaps also useful for us as a mid run crash means a restart

R - at the end of memory this denotes a register buffer which will increase speed

DIMM - dual inline memory module

SDRAM - synchronous dynamic random access memory has a clock which provides for better pipelining with the processor
