I've tried to follow the instructions on windows xp homepage and done a little more digging, but this problem seems difficult to solve without some help from nuit.  Therefore, I am going to see if steve wont let me switch to the home user account.  And if he won't then I will get on the phone and yell at him a bit.  Especially in light of the fact that the home and home office antivirus/spyware package is 1/2 of the price of the one that Steve tried to sell me.  We've been long term customers and we don't need to be treated in that manner.
