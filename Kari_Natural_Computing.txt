Genome v Silicon
	!!computations		the genomic computer performs many times more (source?)
	!!channels		as needed molecular transport and ion diffusion v fixed wires
	!!synchrony		casual coordination v imposed temporal synchrony	
	!!architecture		changeable	v	rigid
	!!memory location		everywhere	v	dedicated locations
	!!robustness		selection/feedback at many levels (molecule, pathway, cell, organism)	v	selection, but also rigirous design criteria
	!!hardware		same as software... but I take exception on this point, I think there is a spectrum from DNA to RNA to protein and so on
	!!turing			The entire genomic regulatory system can be thought of as a computational system, the “genomic computer.” 20... proof

synthetic biology:
	!!largest (viral)		5,386bp synthetic genome of a virus, by rapid (14-day) assembly of chemically synthesized short DNA strands. 37
	!!largest (bacterial)	Recently an announcement was made of the near completion of the assembly of an entire “minimal genome” of a bacterium, Mycoplasma Genitalium.7
	!!understood synthetic	proposal to create a functionally/structurally understood genome, (151 genes - 113,000bp) capable of protein synthesis and DNA replication. 17

Misc
	!!turing cilliates 14	it was proved that various models of gene assembly have full Turing machine capabilities. 23
	!!template cilliates	“bioware” that implements the process of gene assembly, which is based on the new concept of templateguided recombination.4, 28
	!!immune computation	the immune system performs complex, parallel, and distributed computations (a.k.a. immunological computation, immunocomputing) 11
	!!Zuse and Fredkin	In the 1960s, proposed that information is more fundamental than matter or energy - the entire universe is some kind of computational device.
	!!common language		there is no generally accepted common language to describe these biological phenomena 18
	!!membrane computing	Computing models abstracted from the structure and the functioning of living cells, tissues, and higher order structures. 26
	
Glossary
	!!passive memory		does not require energy to persist
	!!communication channels	medium used to transmit a message across space/time
	!!Kohn-maps		symbolic diagrams of protein pathways in cells (see http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=10436023)
	!!bio-calculus		a mathematical language for biological interactions (see http://www.jsbi.org/journal/GIW99/GIW99F14.pdf)
	!!Process calculus	a group of languages used to model concurrent systems
	!!concurrent systems	computational process which are happening simultaneously
