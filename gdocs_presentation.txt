why gdocs is a good solution to our labs needs
	1. Files are password protected
	2. Files are accessible anywhere with the web.  Also you can add offline access to keep access to them when you want.
	3. We don't proliferate a million copies of a documents
	4. Sharing a document is as easy as sending a link
	5. Document Changes are kept track of

	3. it is less useful if documents need to be in word format (like grant proposals)
	4. we have to collaborate around a central folder
