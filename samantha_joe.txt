	My cousin Sammy

5/14/2010
	I went to St. Louis with Ally to watch Sammy Joe graduate with her master's degree.  Its pretty cool to see all my cousins getting so mature.  She's going to be an audiologist which often has to work closely with speech pathologists because so many speech problems are hearing related.  Either way I don't think she is looking forward to moving, but she is very happy to graduate.
	One of my fav parts of the trip was riding the bus with Ally up to st. louis.  It was ever so much fun, I learned to play the facebook hotel game.
