	The allegations at NU that I was illegally uploading G.I. Joe

To Do:
    Reactivate NetID - call Roger (the security dude) at 467-6437


Changed Password - February 13th
Nihad - February 16th
Warning Emails - February 16th and 19th
March 1st, about 12pm - the date of the accused download
March 4th, talked to Gayle and Paul, then exchanged emails https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#search/p2p/1273028362ce92fb
March 11th, - sent out our mac addresses https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#sent/1274e8370d6109bc
March 12 - just talked to Nihad.  The P2P was hers as expected.  The movie had been downloaded in egypt and she did not realize it was still running on her machine.  Because I used my credentials to log her in, she never recieved the warning messages about use.  In the meanwhile, she hasn uninstalled the program for good.
March 16th - met with Paul, now the password sharing is the bigger deal.  Still as Gayle rightly points out we did not share passwords, I just logged onto a co-worker's machine.
March 17th - Roger will reset my net id https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox/12768ae5fda96634
March 24th - I called NUIT and they said I could come into the ER repair or contact my local IT person (me).  I'm gonna talk to Tanja and then not worry about it.
