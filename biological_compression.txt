	The compressiblity of biological codes

Hypothosis 1
	Highly compressible nucleic acids are likely to contain non-compressible modification at some point in time.

Genomes are largely redundant, so they may be compressed to about 10% of their original size (http://hc.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/JSBi/journal/GIW01/GIW01P130/index.html).
