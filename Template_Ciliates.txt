	!!template cilliate	"Template-guided recombination for IES elimination and unscrambling of genes in stichotrichous ciliates"
	!!P, E and R authors	Prescott, Ehrenfeucht, and Rozenberg - Boulder, CO - J Theor Biol (2003) *cited:24*

Summary
	The micronucli of exmated ciliates is converted to a polytene macronucli by cutting, splicing, MDS rearangement and IES excision from 25,000 genes.  Because MDS pointers contain insufficient information to define the new macronucleus and evidence suggests that the vestigal macronucleus affects the production of the next macronucleus (Douharcourt et al 1998), the authors suggest that the micronuclus uses the vestigal macronucleus as a template.

Mechanism
	!!IES's density			4/gene
	!!gene count			25,000
	!!mate timing			when resources are scarce
	!!micronucli # in mate		4
	!!micronucli exchange		1 is passed through a cytoplasmic bridge
	!!diploid fusion			the exchanged micronucli fuses with another
	!!extra micronucli		are removed from the systme
	!!pointers			3-20 bp shared between MDS's to be joined, not long enough to reliably guide fusion

Interesting points:
	!!template operands		3 molecules irreversiably produce 4 molecules
	!!recombination operands		2 molecules reversibly produce 1 molecules?

Questions:
	!!transcriptome template		perhaps there is room for a template-guided model between the transcriptome(n) and transcriptome(n-1) or the virome?
	!!physical evidence		has there been any further research to support or refute this claim with physical models?
	!!mechanism necessary		is macronulecues formation through excision and reordering computationally rich regardless of its mechanism?
