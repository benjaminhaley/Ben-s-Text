    We've handled the vast bulk of Michael's hiring day stuff (http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox/12628c7a4a5ef88b) and now we are on to the process of activating his ID.

    I contacted the shipping doc before the move.  It was a great idea.  The data arrived in decent shape, on crates.  It was only a little messy because they had stacked 1/2 full boxes which smashed in the move.  After a little hassle and a couple of stuck elevators we managed a moving technique to get all of the materials into the floor on time with everyone moving at full steam.
