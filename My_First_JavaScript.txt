JavaScript can be embeded in the header of html files.  Files can be written in a text editor then run on a web browser.  The following is a simple example which can be run by following this link: http://localhost/Archives/HTML_JavaScript_Test.html.

	<HTML>
	<HEAD>
	
	<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
	<!-- Beginning of JavaScript - 

	function MsgBox(textstring) {
	alert(textstring)}

	// - End of JavaScript -->
	</SCRIPT>
	</HEAD>
	<BODY>
	
	<FORM>
	<INPUT NAME="text1" TYPE=Text>
	<INPUT NAME="submit" TYPE=Button VALUE="Show Me" onClick="MsgBox(form.text1.value)">
	</FORM>

	</BODY>

It is standard practice to declare javascript with the tag <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"> <!-- and --> </SCRIPT>.  The <!-- --> is used by HTML to denote comments and is used to prevent incompatiable browsers from rendering javascript code on the page.  Functions are declared as so: function MyFunction(input){ (stuff to do to an input) }

The Alert Command opens a msg box.  Forms in the HTML body work to solicit user actions and input, they are denoted by <FORM> and </FORM> tags.  The forms used in this example are 1. a text box which would has a NAME and TYPE 2. A button which has a NAME, a TYPE, VALUE (which appears inside the button) and ONCLICK command. The ONCLICK variable is followed by a function that the button calls.
