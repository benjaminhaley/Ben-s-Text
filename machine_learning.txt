	my pursuits in learning (maybe applying) the feild

First hunt for terminology: 
	machine learning, 
	reinforcement learning, (best source http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Reinforcement_learning)
		agent, action (modified through dynamic programming), environment (a Markov Decision Process), reward (reinforcement signal)
		Temporal Difference Learning, monte carlo method, sampling, policy
			TD learning is most closely associated with R. S. Sutton, whose 1984 Ph.D. dissertation addressed TD learning and whose 1988 paper
		Q-Learning
		Adaptive Actor-Critics
		*Has been used to simulate animal learning ala Sutton and Barto 1981, Montague et al 1995, Porr and Wörgötter 2003). 
		*It was essentially the work of Klopf (1972, 1975, 1982, 1988), that began to bring TD-methods together with animal learning theories.
	Control Theory
		classical control theory, open loop, closed loop
		SISO, MIMO, PID
		Stability, Controlibility, Observability
		Intellegent Control
	neurobiology,
		Reward Signals, operant conditioning
	cell communications
		
Glossary:
	Markov Decision Process		(MDP) A math framework to model decision making processes where part of the result is under the control of the observer and part is random
	dynamic Programming
	One-armed bandit		A thought experiments which highlights the need to balance exploration with explotation by making an analogy to a man playing many slot machines without knowing thier outcomes, hence he must either choose to explore more statistics or use the thus-far statistically best slot
	Predictive State Representation	A dynamical system interpretation that keeps track of the state in the form about of predictions of the future state (like ALVIN)
	Temporal Difference Learning	A prediction method that solves reinforcement problems by adjusting the model even before the final outcome is fully known.  For example, because Friday accurately predicts the weather of Saturday, Monday's role in the model can be adjusted when Friday comes even before Saturday finally arrives
	Q-Learning			Asks what the expected value of an action is given a subsequently fixed model (model that will not further adjust).  This limits the need to model the way that new information emerges from the environment that would effect the model
	Dynamic Treatment Regimes	A set of treatment decisions predicated on the branching history that has been observed
	Markov Chain			A chain of events with the Markov Property
	Markov Property			Given the Current state, The future state is independent of the past states
	open loop controller		sets an input and does not change in response to the output
	closed loop controller		sets at input and modifies it based on the observed output
	Single-Input Single-Output	(SISO) the most simple controller where only one input is effected by only one output
	Multi-Input Multi-Output	(MIMO) more complex controller whose behavior and inputs are multi-variable vectors
	Proportional Integral Derivative	(PID) is the most well studied controller which makes the input signal a function of the output, its derivative and integral which serves to prevent sudden jumps and allows for changes in the acceleration depending on the current rate
	Intellegent Control		Controller techniques that use modern AI approaches, neural networks, machine learning, genetic networks, and so on
	Reward Signals			Brain signals perhaps deriving from dopagenic neurons that guide subsequent behavior
	operant conditioning		The ways in which an organism is guided by rewards towards certain behaviors 
	shaping				Gradually changing a response over successive trials
