cygwin_tutorial
	To familiarize myself with command line interface programming


Cygwin is a UNIX like command line interface for windows, I am working through a Unix tutorial at http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html






Concepts
	Kernal				Hub of Unix which allocates time and memory and handles filestores and calls to the system
	Shell				The interface between the user and Kernal
	File v Process			Everything is one or another, files store data where Processes are executing programs
	standard input			This is the keyboard and it will be reffered to if you do not specify a file as the input


Nomenclature
	outside c:\cygwin 		To read/write a file outside of c:\cygwin use a pathname beginning with /cygdrive/c/. 
					( c:\My Documents\hello.c   becomes:   /cygdrive/c/My\ Documents/hello.c )
	.				current directory
	..				parent directory
	*				matches any string of characters
	?				matches any single character



Commands
	
	ls [-a, -l]			lists the contents of the directory that don't begin with a dot (.), 
						-a retrieves hidden files
						-l lists permissions and modified time
	mkdir				makedirectory
	cd				change directory
	pwd				lists the full pathname from the root
	cp				copy
	mv				move
	rm | rmdir			remove | remove directory
	cat				outputs the content of a file or concatenation of files
	less [/]			search [/term]
	grep				prints each line containing a character
	^D				control D terminates the standard input (like the end of a file)
	>				redirects the output so it goes to the value on the right side instead of the standard output
	who				lists the names of people on the system with you
	<				redirects the input to the item specified to the right of the <
	|				makes the output of one command the input of the next (pipes)
	man				gives the manual for the following command
	chmod				changes the permissions for files (+/- for r[ead]/w[rite]/x[ecute] for u[ser]/g[roup]/o[ther])
	ps				lists all active processes
	& [-bg]				causes a prompt to be run concurrently
						bg runs the process in the background
	jobs				lists backgrounded, suspended, and running processes
	^c				cancels a process
	df				shows off the disk usage
	gzip & zcat			zips a file & reads a zipped file
	find				looks for files or folders
	history				shows all of the commands that have been made in order
