Find the least mean squared solution to the following observations

1, 1, 1, 1, 
1, 1, 1, 1, 
1, 1, 1, 100

2 -> 10  + 9604 = 9614
3 -> 40  + 9409 = 9449
4 -> 90  + 9216 = 9306
5 -> 160 + 9025 = 9185
6 -> 250 + 8836 = 9086
7 -> 360 + 8649 = 
8 -> 490 + 8464 = 
9 -> 640 + 8281 = 


*but this is lunacy, clearly the correct projection of this situation is 1, with the occasional extreme outlier, simplifying to a ols is nuts
