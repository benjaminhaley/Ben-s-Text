The following titles seemed like they might have some promise, review their contents and find any that need to be integrated into the paper.

Increased expression of genes in a radioresistant cell strain: modulation of hnRNP E2, Hsp90 and (10.1504/IJLR.2007.017640)
	*CANNOT FIND*	
	RAP-PCR and Gene expression array on Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line V79.  
	Following &#947;-irradiation, expressions of SSBP2, Hsp90 and hnRNP E2 increased steadily in V79 cells. 
	HnRNP K and hnRNP A2 genes decreased at first and then increased, 
	HnRNP C1 gene expression remained unaffected.
	
identification and characterisation of FUS/TLS as a new target of ATM.
	DSB-induced FUS phosphorylation in vivo at Ser42 requires ATM and not DNA–PK.
