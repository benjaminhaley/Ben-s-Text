Itch_Success_Measures:

	To determine if the algorithm used to calculate the itch is effective

It would be useful to have a training dataset for the itch.  It might be nice to look at 100 files and rank them in terms of how much I would like them to come up right now and then compare this ranking I have developed with the results of the current algorithm (or new algorithms I derive).  In producing the training set I imagine that it would be best to draw randomly from the archives folder to reduce the chance of biased based complications.
