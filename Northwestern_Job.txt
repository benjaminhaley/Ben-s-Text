To Do:
	teach Xiong statistics/ learn statistics
	Link to Colaborators (get list from Gayle)
	Add former member's contact info
	upload posters to website
	present winestats (see http://localhost/Archives/Wine_Stats.txt)
	particle coverage with T
	miRNA comparisons between animals for general trends which squelch specific trends

Projects:

	animal databases	(current)		(see http://localhost/Archives/Dog_Tissue_Archive.txt)
	computer administration (continual)		(see http://localhost/Archives/Northwestern_Computer_Administration.txt)
	stastics		(later)			(see http://localhost/Archives/Stata.txt)
	hnRNP			(submitted)		(see http://localhost/Archives/hnRNP.txt)

	In the first month, I submitted the hnRNP paper after adding a paragraph on differentiation, addressing Tanja and Gayle's corrections, and proofing acronym use, comma usage, and sources.  Dave introduced me to computer administation (backups + permissions), the databases (locations and naming conventions), the FTP client, webserver, and stata.  Then, Tanja, Dave, and I drafted a plan for the dog tissue database which I will work on next.  Most importantly, I ran and wrote a report on the winestats.
