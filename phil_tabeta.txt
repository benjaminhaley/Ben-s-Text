	My freind Phil.

	I saw Phil this weekend in SF on my trip to visit Dave.  He's still palling around with Kai and working as a cook in the strip club.  He's watching tons of baseball and doesn't get much wifi.  He was complaining about freinds and I felt bad wondering what will crack him out of his shell.
