Where there is highly compresiable nucliec acids (many copies of the same sequence) the implication is that it is in a variety of states due to methelation or binding partners which makes these seemingly identical regions heterogenous and hence useful.  So it might be proposed that highly repetative stretches of nucliec acids are explicitly in place for the variety of modification states that it can support.
