After parsing qiongs_data.xls and loading it into stata I was able to run some simple logistic regressions which are detailed below.  In the end I treated each organ independently, but put both of the genes into the same model.  We were able to explain about 30% of the variance in the results for each organ and found a few specific contributers which seemed to effect the results.  Cool.  The queries are listed below for reference.


            Good:

            Kidney Query 
                accounted for: 40-5% - not significant

            Heart Query

                significant: gene choice, fractions, age of irradiation
