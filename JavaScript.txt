JavaScript
	I want to be introduced to javascript so I can work with code that uses javascript, notably google desktop api code.
	and design dynamic web content using javascript frameworks particularly for the development of a coaching web portal.

Javascript is a scripting language primarily used for client side web application development.	Implementing Javascript is complicated by incompatiabilities, usually due to a browser's failure to support elements of the Document Object Model (see http://localhost/Archives/Document_Object_Model.txt).  Pre-written javascript libaries allow for easier development of JavaScript advanced applications.
