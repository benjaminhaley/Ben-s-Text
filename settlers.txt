		s_* -> o_*
		b_* -> w_*

File Names:
	what is data?  
    A: Data is functions that access the database
        
	is settlers_transfer real?
	incrementor must do more than increment, maybe turn incrementer
	Resource Menu - I hope this has to do with resouce cards
	tables_info - what tables what info
	B v b why?  I don't like.
	what elements
	what util?

    
    
Things I don't like:
    The password/user info is mixed with the player info (number of cards etc).  I think these should belong to sepperate tables.  Users persist over many games.  Players persist over only a single game.
    The Board v board naming convention which is not windows compatiable
    the posted vabiables (signout, username, etc.) don't have default values
