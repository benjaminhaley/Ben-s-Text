Javascript_Overview
	For a broad sense of how the languanguage is used and constructed.

Core JavaScript is a lightweight language with critical value types like Array, Date and Math and language elements like operators, control structures and statements.  This core language is typically extended by combining it with the DOM client side objects (see http://localhost/Archives/Document_Object_Model.txt) or server side objects which help it manipulate file data and databases on the server.  Full information on Core JavaScript is avaliable at http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference. For 

Java script is a scripting language, a language used to control programs. It is primarily used in client-side web development, to execute code on a distant machines.  Because netscape developed and supported javascript along with Sun Microsystems and later internet explorer developed and supported the compatiable jscript the language a version of javascript has been made into a standard for web scripting by the ECMA International (European Computer Manufacuters International - Geneva) known as ECMA script.  Despite its name javascript is not rooted in java, but rather the Self programming language.

Javascript supports C's structured programming syntax (see http://localhost/Archives/Structured_Programming.txt).  Javascript typing is dynamic, associated with values, not variables.  JavaScript is based on objects which correspond to associative arrays (dictionaries).  JavaScript supports run-time evaluation.  Functions in Javascript are 'first class' that is they are objects themselves.  Innerfunctions are created when thier outer functions are invoked and have access to the variables of the outerfunction.  Javascript is prototype based (see http://localhost/Archives/Prototype_Based_Programming.txt).  Javascript defines scripts as both methods (see http://localhost/Archives/Methods.txt) or functions depending on how they are called.  Javascript is typically very reliant on a web-browser to provide objects and methods for scripts to interact with "the outside world".  Javascript functions are variadic meaning that infinite paramaters can be passed to them.
