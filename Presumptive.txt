Dave angered me this morning when confronting me on my policy of telling the judge that I wasn't moving when pulled over for the speeding ticket instead of emphasizing that I had taken off the seatbelt to pay the toll.  He was right by the letter of the law, the sensibilities of the judge and the pragmatic outcome of the argument, but needless to say I got angry at being told I was wrong.

In the end the confrontation was good because it showed me I was wrong, brought me to a better strategy and forced me to look up the law and prove my old strategy wrong.  The confrontation was bad because it made me feel bad and get mad at my freind.  It would be good in the future to find an easier way of resolving these things.  I think if I came into talks more open minded and less attatched to my previous assumptions it would help.
