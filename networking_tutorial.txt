	A tutorial I am going over to learn for the
	CS subject exam http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/networking/guide/netguide.pdf


(3) Network Topology
	deals with the physical structure of a network

media
	the hardware that supports a network

Types of Networks
	Networks are generally classed as server based
	or peer to peer

Network shapes
	there are many network shapes, especially bus, 
	star, ring and hybrid or mesh networks


(5) Network Hardware Connections

Ethernet Shape
	Ethernet uses a star wiring each computers NIC
	card listens for a break in traffic before
	sending information onto the network.
	collision detection is supported

token-ring
	in a ring or loop shape
	One master interface card creates tokens and
	then passes them around the ring.  If a card
	recieves a token it sends data and then the 
	master interface card regenerates a new token

ARCnet
	Has one master card/computer which keeps a
	table of the other computers on the network
	which are demanding network space by polling

Network Interface Card
	A card built into a computer that provides
	the physical link between the computer and 
	network

Media Access Address
	A unique 56 bit number assigned to each NIC
	card


(7) TCP/IP ports and Addresses

IPv4 vs IPv6
	each network interface card will get an IP
	adress.  IPv4 is 4 bytes, 6 is 6 bytes

DHCP
	Dynamic Host Computer Protocol is a method
	for assigning IP adresses to interface cards
	(mac address to IP adress binding)

IANA
	The International Assigned Numbers Authority
	designates how TCP adresses are allocated

Ports
	The TCP layer defines 65000 ports which are
	used to route messages to applications within
	a machine


(10) Network Protocol Levels

ISO OSI
	The International Standards Organization
	has defined the open systems interconnection
	reference model which is a network protocol
	model

physical layer
	ISO layer of actual hardware

data link Layer
	frametype, address, error control, timing
	logical link control
		maintains a link between computers
		by service access points
	media access control
		coordinates the sending of data?
network layer
	IP, routes messages on the best path

transport layer
	TCP, or UDP uses port numbers and behaves
	differenlty in terms of error handling and
	such

session layer
	Determines if sessions are open for security 
	reasons

presentation layer
	translates the type of data
	
application layer
	Services for users

DOD model
	An older network models (department of defense)
	corresponds to the physical wrapping of data

link
	Adds MAC addressing to info packets
	supports ethernet, SLIP, PPP, token
	ring, and ARCnet

network
	Adds IP address to packets
	supports IP and ICMP

transport
	Adds TCP address to packets	

application
	the actual data itself

daeomn
	a program that runs in the background


(15) IEEE 802
	the 802 standards define a set of network
	standards for sending variable sized packets

contention
	A mediation strategy that allows multiple
	sources to use a network
	CSMA/CD
		carrier sense multiple access with
		collision detection (ethernet)
	CSMA/CA
		carrier sense multiple access with
		collision avoidance
token passing
	a mediation strategy where tokens note the 
	ability to transmit
demand priority
	A hub tracks and designates who wants/gets
	to use a network
polling
	A central huba asks who wants to use the
	network

RCF 894 message structure
	6 bytes destination, 6 bytes source, 2 bytes
	type, 46-1500 bytes data, 4 bytes cyclic
	redundancy check	


(19) Network Categories

Address resolution protocol
	the ARP finds the mac address from the IP address
	or some other network layer address (7 bytes)

Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
	IPv6 mac to IP addressing protocol adds some like
	neighborhood undreachability determination

open shortest path first
	OSPF protocol is an internal datalink protocol used
	within an atononous system to route data through its
	network

Tunnling protocols
	tunnling procotocols like SSH prtocol wrap one 
	protocol within another so that the secondary
	tunnled network runs within a master network
	the secondary network behaves as if its in teh link
	layer even though it isn't

Point to point protocol		
	delievers messages between network cards esp
	ISPs to deliver broadband over the internet

Internet Protocol		
	IP we've looked at, it's proximity organization 
	enables smart routing

Internet control message protocol
	ICMP is a close cousin of IP that relies on the
	same protocol but is not used to deliver application
	data, rather error messages about services or hosts
	also used for ping and traceroute
	
Internet Group Managemenet Protocol
	is a ip extenion to allow multicasting that has been
	outmoded by ipv6.  Multicast prevents a sender from
	having to send multiple copies of a large broadcast
	message.

IPsec
	is an IP extension that provides encryption at the 
	transport level, as opposed to ssh which provides
	encryption through tunnling (app/link layer)

Transmission Control Protocol
	works on end to end systems to set the segment size
	flow rate, and congestion

User Datagram Protocol
	is an alternative to TCP used when end point
	delivery does not have to be garunteed

Border Gateway Protocol
	BGP is the routing protocol of the internet deter-
	mining how to route packets based on IP addresses

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	is the method by which a client can request an
	configuration informatin for an IP address from 
	a provider

Domain Name Server
	an application level networking model that trans-
	lates IP to domain names

File Transfer Protocol
	moves files around without an http server but
	with permissions

Internet Relay Chat
	is a form of real time chat services

Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
	a real time messaging platform that is the basis
	of google wave

NTP 
	a protocol for synching time information across
	a network

IMAP, HTTP
	you know


(22) Network Devices

Repeater
	A repeater can amplify and resend a
	message to increase the range of a signal

Bridge
	A bridge passes along data only reading
	its outermost layer.  It can drop packets.

router
	A router decides where a signal should go
	next on the basis of its address information
	if the packet does not have address info it
	will be dropped

brouter
	A bridge/router which opperates as a router
	when the packet has an address otherwise a 
	bridge

gateway
	A computer used to translate between the 
	packet structure of two different networks

(24) ARP and RARP adress translation

adress resolution protocol
	is accomplished by sending a request across
	the network to see if anyone can resolve
	the IP to MAC address or a router on the other
	network.  The packet is then loaded into an 
	ethernet envelop with a MAC address for either
	the reciever or some router

(26) Network Addressing
	
Network Mask
	A network mask specifies the network address
	by the most significant 1 and the host address
	is turned to zeros

Network/Netmask specification
	a number of the form IP/# designates how many
	of the netmask bits are set to 1.


... at this point I decided to become much more spartan with my notes for the purposes of timely completion

supernetting

(62) so the subnet gateway is used to determine if the packet can be kept on your own network or shipped off to the default gateway based on whether it matches the string of your subnet

masquerading - where someone speaks on behalf of a computer that has no IP address so that a computer w/o a realy os can still be communicated with

Firewall
	packet filtering
	circuit level relay
	application proxy gateway


Domain Name Service
	resolver, name server, database of recourse records (RR)

key management protocols must be used to exchange the encryption keys to enable vpn, RADIUS and ISAKMP are two common options.
	


Unicast v broadcast b multicast
only addressed to one nic card
addressed to every nic card on a network
addressed to a group of nic cards


Tic count
	a count of network time in 1/18 seconds (stupid)


Border Gateway Protocol
	unlike internal dynamic routing protocols, the border gateway protocol has to be agreed upon between networks who then share routing information based on distance optimization (nice because it can be verified externally unlike latency which might be manipulated)


The mail servers are specified in the domain name servers which presumably get thier infromation from apache when you are setting up your own web server.  But then where is apache putting messages that are addressed to it?


In terms of security, there is no reason for me not to be using gmail as my public front.  But then I should also setup an email account that is a purely secure account where only white listed emails can send to me there and I can use that for secure buisness.  This will prevent the spam issue which is the biggest impediment to having an unsupported email account.  The handshake can occur in the open, because it is on me to decide if I want to whitelist for delivery or not, so I don't mind if everyone knows the address.  The only flaw with this plan is if people on the other end are unsecure.  Also I need to be sure that the message is sent via an encrypted ssd tunnel or else it could be intercepted.


A network Driver
	A utility that allows multiple process stacks to access and use the same network interface card w/o conflict.

Universal Naming convention
	is used to reference the files or processes on other computers.  It must take the form \\servername\pathname

AH, so php has to establish a connection with the mysql server, because mysql is a network utility that works on a client server model.  This means that if I get other people in my network I can give them direct acccess to mysql server.  So why aren't we setting up a network for a single mysql database when developing our own software instead of relying on mysql dumps and so on...


WAN
	A wide area network is used to connect distant users (its what we need to synchronize database access across Chris and I)


starting at page 136, there is a list of terms that might be useful for review followed by a list of relavent rfc's and a guide book that is most certainly sorely out of date.
