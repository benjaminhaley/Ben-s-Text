    I just finished trying to get the updated date on the invoice for Tanja only to notice that the invoice is plain text (easily changable) and the date was for Aug 7th which would have been within 3 mo when tanja told me about it.  I became unsure as to whether I had the right facts or not, so I called Tanja for some clarifications.  She gave me the story and when I pressed her on if she needed the quantity or price updated she threw her hands up in the air and told me that she would just deal with it.  It was difficult to hear her upset and it makes me think that I did a poor job of communicating or perhaps the thing that I was calling about wasn't worth it.  I did a poor job of communicating because she did not understand that Steve was going to fix the invoice.  The task maybe didn't matter because it was an interrupting phone call over a hard to earn $600 which has already taken up a lot of time.  I'm sure these issues are frustrating.  I guess I want to avoid these purchasing issues with Tanja in the future.  I wonder if I couldn't just deal directly with Williams or Tiffany.
