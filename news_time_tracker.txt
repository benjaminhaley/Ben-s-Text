	To find out how long it takes me to find interesting information.

Systems Biology 9/2/2009
	Start time: 11:00
	146 Articles

Bioinformatics - 2/36 articl
	One on information flow in proteins, 
	one one a software utility for traking cell motility
	Three new vocabulary
BMC Bioinformatics 0/24
BMC Systems biology 0/3
Oxford Briefings in bioinfo 0/10
PLOS Comp Bio 2/30
	A quick guide to R for comp bio students
	Neurons using action signals to relay internal repair signals
q-bio on ArXiv 1/31
	Na+ and Ca2+ movement paper 

By 11:32 I was done reading the titles for all 146 articles
By 11:53 I had found definitions for the four new vocab words
by 12:24 I have finished perusing the 5 articles, 1 was interesting, the one on traking cell motility

So the numbers for system Bio
	146 Article Titles ( 30 minutes, 5 titles/min )
	5 new vocabs ( 20 minutes, 4 minutes/word )
	5 interesting articles ( 30 min, 6 min/article )
	1 useful result ( 1:20 / result )



I get more stuck on vocab for the first few articles, then I seem to move on.  Also my reading comprehension for the titles increases after the first few.
